Good and Bad Health Indicators

Assess all 12 houses and planetary data using the below principles:

✅ Good Health Indicators:

Strong Lagna: contains benefic planets or is aspected by benefic planets
Lagna Lord – placed in own/friendly/neutral sign, exalted or not in 6/8/12 houses
Subhkartari Yoga – benefic planets on both sides of Lagna
Moon/Sun unafflicted (no aspect/conjunction of Rahu, Ketu, Mars, Saturn)
Benefics in Kendra/Trikona
Malefics in 3/6/11
Saturn in 8H (for health endurance)
Strong 8th House Lord
Strong Atmakaraka (dignity, house, aspects)
8th House receives benefic aspect

❌ Bad Health Indicators:

Weak Lagna: contains malefic planets or is aspected by malefic planets
Weak Lagna Lord: placed in enemy sign, debilitated or in 6/8/12 houses
Paapkartari Yoga – malefic planets on both sides of Lagna
Afflicted Sun or Moon: in enemy house, debilitated, aspect/conjunction of Rahu, Ketu, Mars, Saturn
6th Lord is a malefic or under malefic aspect
Lagna Lord is conjunct with 6th Lord (or in 6/8/12)
Any planets placed in 6/8/12 → assess affliction
Rahu/Ketu in 1/7 or 6/8 axis → karmic health volatility
6th Lord connects with 8th Lord → chronic disease risk
