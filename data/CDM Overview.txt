1. What is CDM
•	Stands for Common Domain Model.
•	A standardized, machine-readable, and executable blueprint for financial product lifecycle events.
•	Distributed as open-source by FINOS (originally developed by ISDA).

2. Purpose & Benefits
•	Enables interoperability and straight-through processing across firms.
•	Reduces reconciliation needs by standardizing event representations.
•	Promotes transparency and regulatory consistency.
•	Provides a common base for FinTech innovation (DLT, AI, smart contracts).

•	Event Model: Captures lifecycle events (e.g., execution, settlement).
•	Process Model: Standardizes and automates business workflows.
