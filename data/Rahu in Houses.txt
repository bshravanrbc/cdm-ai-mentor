Rahu in Houses
Rahu is considered a 'Node,' 'Chayagrah,' or Shadowy planet and has a distinct, profound, and predictable impact on human lives.
Although Rahu is not an observable heavenly body with shape and size like other planets, it has strong influencing power.
Rahu or Dragon's Head or North Node represents foreigners, foreign countries, foreign travel, engineering and technical trades, smoke, old men, grandparents, theft, gambling, drinking, nonconformists, the underworld, and bad elements in society.
Its color is black, its metal is mixed-metal, and its gem is Gomedh.
