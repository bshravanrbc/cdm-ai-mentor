Introduction to Houses (Bhav)
The term "Bhav" is derived from Sanskrit, meaning emotions or feelings. By studying the 12 houses in a horoscope, one can understand all aspects of a person's life. Each house indicates certain characteristics or topics about the native.
First House
•	This house represents the native’s head, mental capacity, appearance, behavior, height, physique, and body functions. If we focus mainly, this house is the most important because it is through this house that all experiences of the world are processed. For instance, this house acts like the foundation of a house, which supports and energizes the entire structure (all other houses), allowing the native's life to flow smoothly.
•	When a native addresses themselves or when someone addresses a native, the first house or ascendant is being referred to.
•	The strength of this house is crucial, as it symbolizes our immune system. It determines how the native behaves in adverse conditions—whether they break down or stand firm and face the situation head-on—this can be seen from the ascendant.
•	The native's personality, thoughts, beauty, hair, eyes, and overall appearance are observed from this house.
•	The significator (karaka) of the ascendant is the Sun, and it holds the influence of both positive and negative forces, symbolizing Shiva (the unified form of male and female energy).
Second House
•	This house represents the native's face, teeth, gums, tongue, and the right eye. It also governs food habits, family, early childhood education, and speech. Wealth, accumulated money, jewelry, and sustenance are also linked to this house.
•	Banks and financial reserves are viewed from this house. In the cosmic chart, this house is ruled by Taurus, and Venus is associated with the goddess Lakshmi, signifying wealth. This house is also a maraka (death-inflicting) house, as it governs sustenance and could lead to the end of life if malefic influences dominate.
•	Jupiter is the significator of the second house.
Third House
•	This house governs communication. All forms of communication, writing, and translation come under this house.
•	It also indicates courage, effort, and enterprise. Any extraordinary effort is signified by this house. Initiative and ventures are linked to this house as well.
•	The significator of this house is Mars, and in the cosmic chart, Gemini rules this house. The combined influence of Mars and Mercury makes this house associated with all forms of daring activities and sports.
•	It also governs hobbies and interests.
•	The third house includes our hands, throat, and ears, symbolizing that whatever actions we perform with our hands are linked to this house.
•	Relationships with younger siblings and spiritual teachings from the guru are also seen from this house.
Fourth House
•	In the cosmic chart, this house is ruled by the Moon and symbolizes the mother, homeland, and house.
•	A person may have several properties, but a home is unique, and all the happiness derived from material comforts, land, and wealth is governed by this house.
•	The mother’s nurturing care and comfort, along with land and property, are observed from this house.
•	The Moon is also the significator of this house. Any malefic influence here can cause disturbances in one's peace, joy, and happiness.
Fifth House
•	This house governs the mind and intellect of the native and their capacity to learn. It is also the second house of the trine (trikona) after the first house.
•	It governs education and learning, mantras, and also the capacity to absorb spiritual teachings.
•	The house represents past life merits (purva punya), as learning and education are considered a result of good deeds from a past life.
•	This house is also linked to progeny and future planning. The strength of this house determines how a person’s future will unfold and whether they will have children.
•	It also governs love, creative expression, and leisure activities.
•	The Sun is the ruler of the cosmic fifth house, meaning the energy consumed by the mind also depends on what one feeds it (e.g., mental diet). If one indulges in negative thoughts or activities, the future could be negatively impacted.
•	This house is also responsible for progeny, entertainment, and creativity, making it a critical house for teachers and mentors.
Sixth House
•	This house governs debt, diseases, and enemies. It also represents the six enemies (lust, anger, greed, attachment, arrogance, and envy).
•	Internal and external enemies are viewed from this house. It is considered one of the malefic houses because it binds the native in debts and challenges, which can only be resolved when the karmic debts are repaid.
•	Mars and Saturn are significators of this house, and the struggles encountered in life, such as health issues and debts, are seen here.
•	This house is also linked to competition and conflict. All forms of competition, such as exams or sporting events, are connected to the sixth house.
