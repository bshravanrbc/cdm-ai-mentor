CDM Event Model 
Purpose: Represents the lifecycle events of financial trades — from execution to termination — as structured, traceable state transitions.
•	Core Design Principles:
	o Every lifecycle event = a state transition (before → after).
	o Trade states are composable and functional — built from modular logic blocks.
	o Lineage: Full trade history is reconstructable through linked trade states.
	o The product definition remains immutable throughout the lifecycle.

Key Components:
•	TradeState: Captures the current status of a trade (trade details, state, reset history, transfer history).
•	State: Specifies status flags like closedState (e.g., Terminated, Novated) and positionState.
•	Reset: Applies observed values (e.g., interest rates) to floating structures based on market data.
•	Transfer: Models asset movement (cash, securities, etc.) from one party to another.
________________________
Primitive Operators (building blocks of events):
•	Execution: Create a new trade.
•	QuantityChange: Modify trade quantity or price.
•	TermsChange: Amend trade terms.
•	PartyChange: Change counterparties.
•	Exercise: Execute an option.
•	Reset: Update floating-rate values.
•	Transfer: Move an asset between parties.
•	ContractFormation: Link legal documentation.
•	Split: Clone a trade into smaller identical trades.
__________________________
Business Event:
•	A composite of primitive instructions affecting one or more trades.
•	Atomic: all instructions execute together or none do.
•	eventQualifier: Inferred label (e.g., Termination) based on logic.
•	intent: Optional metadata indicating event purpose (e.g., Novation, Allocation).
__________________________
Workflow:
•	Represents steps leading to a business event, including approvals, rejections, or pre-agreed next events.
•	Tracks lineage across steps for auditability.
